'''Problem Statement
Sophia is developing a program to generate a 2D matrix where each element is the product of its row and column indices. She needs to write a program to take the number of rows and columns as input and return a matrix filled such that each element at position (i, j) equals i × j. 

Write a program to ensure that the task is done.
Input format :
The first line contains a single integer R, representing the number of rows in the matrix.
The second line contains a single integer C, representing the number of columns in the matrix.
Output format :
The output prints "Generated 2D Matrix:" on one line.
The next lines print the full matrix using the default string format of a NumPy matrix object:
All rows must appear inside a single pair of outer square brackets [[...]],
Each row is printed on a new line,
No extra spaces should be printed before or after the brackets or elements.
Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.
Code constraints :
2 ≤ R, C ≤ 10
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3
3
Output 1 :
Generated 2D Matrix:
[[0 0 0]
 [0 1 2]
 [0 2 4]]'''
import numpy as np
R= int(input())
C=int(input())
matrix=np.fromfunction(lambda i, j: i*j, (R,C), dtype=int)
print("Generated 2D Matrix:")
print(matrix)
